Subhmay Patra,5,Worth every penny,"Received a signed copy and it's a hardcover as well. The book looks plain yet very attractive. It's so lightweight, I loved the physical characteristics of the book, especially owing to the fact that it's a properly bound hardcover. The book has been written in a very easy to understand manner. A must have book."
Sam Customer,5,Awesome,Start from any page and you can read from there. Good one. Highly recommended. Every paragraph kept me thinking for 5-10 min about the content. This is not a book to read in one go. It's read according to the time when you really need that self help.
